Color recognition works to identify different color candies in an image.

### Basic Usage

Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To count the number of colored candy in an image
```bash
python color_detect.py -i 'path to image'
```
###Example
```bash
python color_detect.py -i image1.jpg
```
In the same directory you are running the program a file `out.jpg`
with the color count showing on the image will be created.

####ToDo
- Allow color count in videos.
